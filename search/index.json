Applicants will be notified of their eligibility in November.\nYou no longer will be able to modify your information on the platform. Your application PDF will now be available for download when you log in to the GRI Application Platform under the \u0026lsquo;Application\u0026rsquo; tab.\nImportant dates:\nNovember 2023: Mitacs notifies each applicant of their eligibility and next steps\nNovember 2023 to January 2024: Mitacs provides professors with a shortlist of student candidates for their project.

Please be aware that eligibility and interviews do not guarantee an internship offer.\n因此面试通过确实不保证能进项目组，mitacs机制玄学\n$\\Rightarrow$ 一篇关于Mitacs的博客\n通过初筛 11.8 身边认识的两个同学都没通过mitacs的初筛，11.4 当日被拒了，很直接地说 not eligible。今年申请人数3w+，项目2k+。我 11.8 收到初筛通过邮件，进入下一阶段：从11月教授开始挑人，下次状态更新要到12月或1月中旬。\nDear Dafu Zhu,\nThank you for your interest in Mitacs’s Globalink Research Internship (GRI).\nWe have completed our review of all GRI applications, and we are glad to inform you that your application is deemed eligible for a 2024 Globalink Research Internship. At this point, please do not contact any professors or book any tickets. This status update does not mean that you are granted a position for the 2024 Globalink Research Internship.\nThis email is only meant to provide information about the different status updates that you may receive during the next phase.\nDuring the matching phase, your application may be updated to one of the following statuses:\nWaitlisted: There’s no action needed from you when you receive this status update. You will receive an email with a status update in mid-December and in mid-January; OR\nCandidate under consideration: There’s no action needed from you when you receive this status update.\ni.Please do not contact any professors unless they reach out to you firstYou may or may not be called for an interview. Please diligently check your email, including your spam or junk folders for any emails from professors. The format of the professor’s assessment or interview is up to the professor. If you have questions about logistics and our program, please contact helpdesk@mitacs.ca. Professors will not be able to answer any questions about funding, immigration, and travelling.\nii.Your status can change to waitlisted at any point; this is not reflective of the quality of your application.\niii.We\u0026rsquo;ll consider your ranking during the matching process.

Being “Waitlisted” implies that our team is working to find the best match for your profile.\nPlease note that Mitacs will make every effort to match eligible candidates with projects, within the scope of Government of Canada guidelines and/or directives on research security. Mitacs reserves the right to decline applications on the grounds of research security concerns or approve applications conditional on additional research security requirements as appropriate.\nWaitlist通知 11.11 上封邮件说12月和1月中旬开始匹配，这封应该所有人都一样的，先设成 waitlist 之后再更新。\nThank you for your interest in Mitacs’s Globalink Research Internship (GRI). We are writing to inform you that your application status has been updated to “Waitlisted”.\nPlease note that no action is currently required. Applicants are asked not to contact professors at this time. You will receive an email with a new status update in mid-December and in mid-January. Your application may or may not be updated to “Candidate Under Consideration”. If your status changes, Mitacs will update your status and send you an email notification with further instructions.\nYour current status does not reflect the quality of your application. The Globalink Research Internship program is highly competitive with over 30,000 applications and limited availability; therefore, Mitacs cannot offer direct feedback on your application. All results will be finalized by the end of February 2024.\nPlease note that Mitacs will make every effort to match eligible candidates with projects, within the scope of Government of Canada guidelines and/or directives on research security. Mitacs reserves the right to decline applications on the grounds of research security concerns or approve applications conditional on additional research security requirements as appropriate.\n乌龙 原来是 mitacs 那边犯的错误，对外说毕业月份不重要，但把很多填 2025.6 毕业的给筛掉了。\n","date":"2023-09-14T00:00:00Z","image":"https://markdafu.github.io/p/mitacs%E7%94%B3%E8%AF%B7/cover_hud7e36f7e20e71be184458283bdae4646_55974_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://markdafu.github.io/p/mitacs%E7%94%B3%E8%AF%B7/","title":"Mitacs申请"},{"content":"For more details, check out the documentation.\nBilibili video Tencent video YouTube video Generic video file Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.
