Dear Dafu,

Mitacs is no longer accepting 2024 Globalink Research Internship applications.

We are now reviewing all applications to determine their eligibility. Applicants will be notified of their eligibility in November.

You no longer will be able to modify your information on the platform. Your application PDF will now be available for download when you log in to the GRI Application Platform under the 'Application' tab.  

Important dates:  

**November 2023:**
Mitacs notifies each applicant of their eligibility and next steps  

**November 2023 to January 2024:**
Mitacs provides professors with a shortlist of student candidates for their project. Applicants may be interviewed by professors at any time of the matching process. Mitacs collects student and professor rankings.

**Mid-February 2024:**
Selected applicants receive an internship offer by mid-February 2024 and results are finalized

Due to the high volume of applicants, Mitacs cannot offer direct feedback on your application. Please be aware that eligibility and interviews do not guarantee an internship offer.

注意：

> **Due to the high volume of applicants, Mitacs cannot offer direct feedback on your application. Please be aware that eligibility and interviews do not guarantee an internship offer.**

因此面试通过确实不保证能进项目组，mitacs机制玄学
